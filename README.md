# avl-tree
<h1>Language and Framework</h1>
Java (Eclipse)

<h1>Implementation of Hash Function Using Hash Tables</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
This program very efficiently uses the AVL tree data structure.

<h2>Design</h2>
<b>The calculateNR file is used to run tests.</b> The AVL Tree class implements various AVL operations and is a main supporting file to start with.

<h3>Functions</h3>

1. check if tree is empty
2. remove all elements/nodes
3. Make the tree logically empty
4. insert data 
5. get height of node 
6. check if node is external (null)
7. modify the value of a node
8. rebalance by rotating binary tree node with left child
9. rebalance b rotating binary tree node with right child
10. check if the tree is a binary search tree
11. check if the tree is an AVL tree
12. check if the tree is balanced
13. Double rotate binary tree node: first left child with its right child; then node k3 with new left child 
14. Double rotate binary tree node: first right child with its left child; then node k1 with new right child
15. count number of nodes
16. search for an element
17. inorder traversal
18. preorder traversal
19. postorder traversal
